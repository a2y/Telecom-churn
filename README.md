Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for telecommunications companies, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This case study leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand and predict customer churn, providing actionable insights for the business.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes customer information, usage patterns, service details, and churn labels. It is assumed to be sourced from a telecommunications company's customer database. The key features include:

Customer ID
Demographic information
Service subscription details
Usage patterns
Customer support interactions
Churn status
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main sections:

data/: Contains the dataset and any data preprocessing scripts.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model building.
src/: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
results/: Outputs of the analysis, including visualizations and model performance metrics.
docs/: Documentation and related files.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telecom-churn-case-study.git
cd telecom-churn-case-study
Create a virtual environment:

sh
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the analysis and model training, execute the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory. Ensure that your working directory is set to the project's root folder. You can launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the telecom-churn-case-study.ipynb notebook and follow the steps outlined to perform data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

Results
The key results of the analysis include:

Identification of major factors contributing to customer churn.
Predictive models with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations that provide insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.
These results are documented in the results/ directory and within the Jupyter notebooks.
